# global_policy_scrapers
Scrapers for every country in the world's laws :)

What if all the world’s laws on climate existed in one place, allowing people to easily find and compare laws across countries, better understand what works and what’s feasible for countries to do, and build the evidence base to argue for better laws and policies that meaningfully address climate change?

We are working to achieve this! We’re creating a custom search engine and repository for global legislation to enable the WORLD Policy Analysis Center and others to source and analyze legislation about climate change. To do this, we are writing custom scrapers in python for every country's legislative repositories, translating them, indexing them and serving them through a web interface.

# TODOs
* Manage all (python & system) depedencies for all scrappers. We could use docker or nix.
